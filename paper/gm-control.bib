  abstract =	"We introduce the use of learned shaping rewards in
		 reinforcement learning tasks, where an agent uses prior
		 experience on a sequence of tasks to learn a portable
		 predictor that estimates intermediate rewards,
		 resulting in accelerated learning in later tasks that
		 are related but distinct. Such agents can be trained on
		 a sequence of relatively easy tasks in order to develop
		 a more informative measure of reward that can be
		 transferred to improve performance on more difcult
		 tasks without requiring a hand coded shaping function.
		 We use a rod positioning task to show that this
		 significantly improves performance even after a very
		 brief training period.",
